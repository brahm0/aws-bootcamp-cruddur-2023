# Week 1 — App Containerization
## Create a new GitHub repo.
i didn't create a new github repository since we are working in the 'main'.  

## Configure Gitpod.yml configuration, eg. I’m VSCode Extensions
I configured the file as shown in the video during the live stream. To be candid, i was just following the steps Andrew was taking. I didn't fully understood what i was doing.

## Clone the frontend and backend repo.

## Explore the codebases

## Ensure we can get the apps running locally
Again i was able to achieve this by following the video steps.

## Write a Dockerfile for each app.
Docker file was written for each app as shown in the video.

## Ensure we get the apps running via individual container.

## Create a docker-compose file.
Docker-compose file was made.

## Ensure we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side.

## Mount directories so we can make changes while we code
